## Original readme.

OpenThread Border Router add-on. The add-on uses the upstream OpenThread
Border Router implementation and wraps it as an add-on for Home Assistant.

**NOTE:** This requires a supported 802.15.4 capable radio with OpenThread
RCP firmware. If you are using [Home Assistant Yellow](https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow/) or [Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1](https://www.home-assistant.io/connectzbt1/) (previously called SkyConnect) then
the correct firmware is automatically installed.
